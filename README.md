# Power-BI-Dashboards
This project focuses on creating insightful dashboards and reports for the Adventure Works dataset, showcasing key analytics on sales performance, customer behavior, and product insights. It demonstrates the use of Power BI to transform raw data into meaningful visualizations, enabling better decision-making.

Key highlights include:

Sales Analysis: Detailed breakdown of revenue trends, sales by region, and performance comparisons across time periods.
Customer Insights: Analysis of customer demographics, purchase patterns, and segmentation to identify key customer groups.
Product Insights: Evaluation of product categories, sales performance by product, and inventory trends.
